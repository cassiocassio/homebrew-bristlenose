    # Write a wrapper script that delegates to the venv's bristlenose.
    # Must be a real file (not a symlink) during install so Homebrew's
    # link phase exposes it in /opt/homebrew/bin/ before post_install
    # runs pip.

    (bin/"bristlenose").chmod 0755

    # Install man page from the sdist source so it lands in the Cellar
    # before Homebrew's link phase runs. Installing it in post_install
    # bypasses link, so `man bristlenose` wouldn't resolve. Canonical
    # path is bristlenose/data/bristlenose.1; man/bristlenose.1 is a
    # symlink to it (works either way, but the canonical path is clearer).
    man1.install "bristlenose/data/bristlenose.1"
  end

  def post_install
    # pip install runs in post_install to skip Homebrew's dylib relinking
    # phase, which fails on pre-built wheels with short Mach-O header
    # padding (av, cryptography). The [serve] extras pull in fastapi /
    # uvicorn / sqlalchemy so `bristlenose serve` works out of the box.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Bristlenose requires an Anthropic or OpenAI API key.
      Set one of:
        export BRISTLENOSE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
        export BRISTLENOSE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

      To keep Bristlenose current, trust this formula:
        brew trust --formula cassiocassio/bristlenose/bristlenose

      Homebrew 6.0 and later skip third-party taps during `brew upgrade`
      unless trusted. Without this, updates stop arriving silently.
